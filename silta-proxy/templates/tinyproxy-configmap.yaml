    # User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
    # used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
    # as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
    # number may be used.

    User tinyproxy
    Group tinyproxy

    #
    # Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
    # that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
    # to start tinyproxy using root.
    #
    Port 80

    #
    # Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
    # allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
    #
    Timeout 600

    #
    # DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
    # HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
    # that has occured.
    #
    DefaultErrorFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/default.html"

    #
    # LogLevel: Warning
    #
    # Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
    #	Critical	(least verbose)
    #	Error
    #	Warning
    #	Notice
    #	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
    #	Info		(most verbose)
    #
    # The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
    # LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
    # Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.

    # MaxClients: This is the absolute highest number of threads which will
    # be created. In other words, only MaxClients number of clients can be
    # connected at the same time.
    #
    MaxClients 100

    #
    # MinSpareServers/MaxSpareServers: These settings set the upper and
    # lower limit for the number of spare servers which should be available.
    #
    # If the number of spare servers falls below MinSpareServers then new
    # server processes will be spawned.  If the number of servers exceeds
    # MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.
    #
    MinSpareServers 5
    MaxSpareServers 20

    #
    # StartServers: The number of servers to start initially.
    #
    StartServers 10

    #
    # MaxRequestsPerChild: The number of connections a thread will handle
    # before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which
    # disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
    # leakage, then set this to something like 10000.
    #
    MaxRequestsPerChild 0

    #
    # Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any
    # access control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise,
    # the default action is ALLOW.
    #
    # The order of the controls are important. All incoming connections are
    # tested against the controls based on order.
    #
    #Allow 127.0.0.1

    # BasicAuth: HTTP "Basic Authentication" for accessing the proxy.
    # If there are any entries specified, access is only granted for authenticated
    # users.
    #BasicAuth user password

    #
    # AddHeader: Adds the specified headers to outgoing HTTP requests that
    # Tinyproxy makes. Note that this option will not work for HTTPS
    # traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what headers are exchanged.
    #
    #AddHeader "X-My-Header" "Powered by Tinyproxy"

    #
    # ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
    # the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
    # is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
    # Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
    #
    ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"
